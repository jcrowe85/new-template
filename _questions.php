                            We understand that there's two types of people that go to our site, if you know what you want to buy, 
                            or if you're shopping around and trying to figure out what you need. We recommend that everyone takes 
                            a quick look at our first time insurance buyer guide section. You may learn something you never knew about!

                            There are a lot of insurance sites out there, but almost all of them will have you talk to an agent, even 
                            if it seems like you can do it all online. We allow all of our users to go through the entire process without 
                            ever talking to an agent (if you don't want to, we do have professionals on standby to help you if you have any questions).

                            We're also a team of former life insurance agents as well as financial advisors. We understand that people have preferences 
                            to buy off certain ideas, whether it's the company, benefits, or price, and we allow everyone to compare and shop from only the most reliable of carriers.

                        We're an independent insurance broker, meaning we do get paid a commission by the insurance carrier for each sale. However, 
                        all the prices are the same whether you go directly to the insurance carrier or to us, as those carriers also have agents who 
                        will receive that same commission. So rest assured, you aren't paying more for our services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Now onto the most common question we get asked if we state that we receive a commission. Are there any conflicts of interest? No,
                        because we don't get paid by any insurance company to represent their products better than any other product on the market. 
                        We give every user the opportunity to buy from whomever they want. We also don't pressure you into doing anything you're not ready to do.

                        We work with only companies that have a solid history AND solid financial ratings. We don't want you to worry that a company doesn't have 
                        enough money to pay claims or goes bankrupt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We also only work with companies that do business through independent brokers. Some companies just aren't competitive in the insurance industry, 
                        but have history on their side. It doesn't benefit their consumers and really only benefits the company. By working with companies that are open to 
                        competing with each other, it brings in better benefits and better prices to you.

                        The price of each insurance product already has the commission factored in, and all prices are regulated by your state's department of insurance. 
                        Meaning you could buy it from a large carrier like Prudential, or from an independent agent down the street from "Joe's Tax and Insurance company", 
                        or from us, and still be given the same price from each source.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                        Be wary though, the base minimum price is the same, but agents can add on riders (extra benefits) that can add an additional cost to the insurance policy.
                        And they can disguise those riders as being required to have.
