The following changes have been made to the September 2017  
edition of the Compulife Quotation System:

1.  Minnesota Life - state approval

September 13th - Minnesota Life's new term rates
are now approved in CA.




================================================================

The following changes were made and were included with the 
September 2017 monthly update of the Compulife Quotation System:

19.  Lincoln National Life - state approval

August 28th (2nd) - Lincoln's new LifeElement term rates
are now approved in HI.


18.  Principal Life (and National) - new rates

August 28th - Principal has introduced new rates for
their Universal Life Protector IV series of UL products.

Compnay quotes these for premiums and level coverage to:

age 90
age 95
age 100
age 105
age 121

From time to time we are asked by customers why we 
do not have other level periods or payment options
for a given company.  The reason is quite simple, that
company did not give us rates for those other periods
and coverages.

NOTE:  We ONLY quote limited pay variations for level
to age 121.


17.  Independent Order of Foresters - state approval

August 28th - Foresters "Your Term" series of term
policies is now approved in NY.  That has been turned
on and the "Lifefirst" term plans removed.


16.  Banner Life and William Penn - my apologies

August 28th - The new rates which were provided
by Banner Life and William Penn, were actually the
second batch.  We have received an earlier batch
of rates and told those would be rolled out August
21st.  Having entered those, and ready to go on 
August 21st, we were then told those were being 
replaced by a second set of rates and were then 
provided those which were entered - ready to go.

My goof, and it was my goof, was that the second
batch were delayed release for a week, and I missed
that and let them go on August 21st, rather than 
the 28th.

After rolling out the rates a week early, I was then
in Florida preparing for the copyright infringement
lawsuit(s), the first two of which will commence in 
October.  I was not made aware of my Banner error 
until Wednesday, and then too late for the company 
to confirm the error and for me to deal with it.

I was then tied up until I got home for the weekend.

Good news - not all rates changed.  However, if you 
sold a Banner policy last week, based upon a quote 
from our software, please double check it to ensure 
it is old or new rates and coordinate with the 
company the correct dating of the policy.

I again apologize for any inconvenience this may
be for our customers.

4.  Protective Life Insurance - health category fixed

August 7th (2) - When I added the new products for 
Protective, I neglected to add the new codes to the
