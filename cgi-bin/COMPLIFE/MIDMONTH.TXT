The following changes have been made to the June 2017  
edition of the Compulife Quotation System:

1.  Independent Order of Foresters - correction

June 1st - We had a problem with the new "Your Term"
products for Foresters Life.  We were quoting "band 2"
for $500,000 and up, when in fact band 2 is for $1,000,000
and up.

The company made us aware of the issue this afternoon,
and this update has the fix.



================================================================

The following changes were made and were included with the 
June 2017 monthly update of the Compulife Quotation System:


8.  United of Omaha - new rates

June Monthly Update - United of Omaha has 
introduced new rates for its Term Life Answers
10, 15, 20 and 30 year term, and has introduced
new rates for its Guaranteed Universal Life 
products.  


7.  Newest Windows Program - bug repair

June Monthly Update - When doing an "annual 
and monthly" premium comparison, with waivers 
added, the annual total was showing the annual 
basic plus the monthly waiver as the total.  

Simple mistake - now fixed.

Our thanks to the subscriber who reported it.


6.  United Farm / United Home - minimum face

May 26th - Compulife did not have the minimum face
for Simpler Term 20 and 30 set to $25,000.  This has
been corrected.


5.  John Hancock Life - state approvala

May 22 - John Hancock's new Vitality Term 
rates are now approved in PA.


4.  Lincoln National Life - new term rate

May 15th - Lincoln's 2017 term rates have
been repriced, and are not approved in all
states.

Lincoln's Life Element new 2017 rates are
not approved in AR, MD, MO, OR and WA.  The
old 2017 rates are still in those states.

We have identifed the OLD 2017 rates as

(01-2017)

Just to make it confusing, the 2016 rates
are still used in AK, HI, MA, PR, VA and VI.

So, 3 generations of rates, depending on the
state.

TermAccel is a little simpler.  The new
2017 rates are approved in all statements
except OR and WA.  We have identified the
old rates as:

(OR&WA)

No changes in NY.


3.  Newest Windows Program - unisex renewal bug

May 12th - We have had a series of bugs that 
flowed originally from a waiver premium renewal
issue for unisex quotes (Montana).

That fix led to a bug, the next fix to another
bug, and so on - you get the idea.

The latest bug was that renewals for unisex (not
waiver), where the unisex renewal was the same as 
male, were not displaying.  Like a dog chasing
its tail.

Anyway, this is now fixed.  

I am confident, with the analysis of the code, 
that that should be the last of it.

Thanks to the customer who turned up the mistake,
and a 10% coupon has been issued.

On a side note, this is WHY we need the overhaul
that we are working on.  In software, you build a 
foundation, and then over time there are changes
that need to be made, to accomodate things you
did not anticipate when you designed the foundation.

This leads to a patchwork of change over time
and eventually you need to take what you have 
learned from that, redesign the foundation to
clean it up and create a new structure that 
eliminates the patchwork.  


2.  United Farm / United Home - product added

May 9th - One of our subscriber asked us to add
the Simple Term 20 DLX product for these companies.

The product is priced for the insulin dependent, 
diabetic market.  


1.  Transamerica Life Insurance - new rates

May 6th - Transamerica has introduced new rate
for its Trendsetter Super and LB products.  There
are other changes.

There are NO changes in NY.  The following apply
to non-NY products.

The new Trendsetter Super rates are based on 
actual age, NOT nearest.

The company is no longer offering product in PR.

The Trendsetter YRT has been withdrawn.

The new rates are NOT available in CA.  The products
in CA remain as is.

The new LB rates are NOT available in VI.
