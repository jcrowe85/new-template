REM   Remarks follow any line which begins with REM.  Any values 
REM   following a REM line will be ignored.  
REM   
REM   The Compulife directory contains the file (CLDOC.INI) and 
REM   another sample file called "CL.INI".  Neither file is actually 
REM   integrated to the Compulife program.  
REM   
REM   The file which does integrate to the Compulife program is called 
REM   
REM                  CLIENT.PRM   (old file name CLIENT.INI)
REM   
REM   We do not provide a CLIENT.PRM file as this is a "shuttle file".
REM   When the GOWIN.EXE program first starts up it looks for the CLIENT.PRM
REM   file and if it finds the file the contents are read by GOWIN.EXE 
REM   into the client record for the software, and then the CLIENT.PRM 
REM   file is deleted.  This read and delete is instantaneous.
REM   
REM   To test how this works you can make a copy of CL.INI to 
REM   CLIENT.PRM by typing 
REM   
REM                        COPY CL.INI CLIENT.PRM 
REM   
REM   This can be done at a DOS prompt in the Compulife directory.  
REM   or you can log into the folder with "My Computer", copy the CL.INI,
REM   paste a second copy, then rename it to CLIENT.PRM.
REM   
REM   You could also copy this file (CLDOC.INI) to CLIENT.PRM and it 
REM   would be processed the same way.  As each of these comment lines 
REM   are preceded by a REM, they are ignored by the GOWIN.EXE program.
REM   
REM   If you take a look at the contents of the CL.INI file you will 
REM   discover that it is divided into sections.  These are:
REM   
REM   [CLIENT 1]
REM   [CLIENT 2]
REM   and
REM   [GENERAL]
REM   
REM   Each section is then divided into variables.  Each individual 
REM   element of the section has been assigned a variable name which 
REM   the Compulife program will recognize when it processes the file.
REM   
REM   Please note: section and variable names are NOT case sensitive.
REM   
REM   Variable names are followed by the = symbol, which is then 
REM   followed by the value that you want the variable set to.  
REM   
REM   Under each client section the following list of variable 
REM   names could or should appear:
REM   
REM   Note:  If you do not set a variable, the value used previously
REM          will be the value used by Compulife
REM   
REM   Birthdate
REM   ActualAge
REM   NearestAge
REM   Sex
REM   Smoker
REM   Pref
REM   PrefPlus
REM   FaceAmount
REM   Name
REM   
REM   The following are the possible answers to the variables which 
REM   follow the [CLIENT 1] section heading:
REM   
REM   Birthdate=02,04,54
REM   
REM   The format is day, month, year.
REM   
REM   ActualAge=42
REM   NearestAge=42
REM   
REM   If you have set the birthdate correctly, it is NOT NECESSARY to 
REM   also assign the two age variables.  This would be REDUNDANT.  
REM   However, should you make a mistake and place both the birthdate 
REM   and age variables into the file, then the last variable will 
REM   dictate what the client age is set to.  Therefore, if there is a 
REM   discrepancy between the birthdate and age, the last variable 
REM   (date or age) will be used by the system.
REM   
REM   Sex=M
REM   
REM   Sex is either M for male, or F for female.  For states which use 
REM   Unisex rates the program ignores the sex field no matter how you 
REM   set it.
REM   
REM   Smoker=N
REM   
REM   Non-Smoker is N.  Y indicates a smoker.  
REM   
REM   Pref=N
REM   
REM   Preferred is Y for yes, N for no.  If this field is set to "no" 
REM   then products which offer preferred rates will be ignored.  Only 
REM   products with standard/regular rates will be included in the 
REM   illustration.
REM   
REM   PrefPlus=N
REM   
REM   Preferred Plus is Y for yes, N for no.  
REM   
REM   
REM   FaceAmount=500000
REM   
REM   Self-explanatory.  No commas and no decimal points.  There should 
REM   be no fractional dollars in a face amount.
REM   
REM   Name="Robert L. Barney"
REM   
REM   The client name must be contained in double quotations which are 
REM   ignored by the program when processing the variable.  The maximum 
REM   length of the client name is 40 characters.  Anything entered beyond
REM   40 characters will be ignored.
REM  
REM   The program ignores everything to this point, then sets the first 
REM   client to the following:
REM  
[CLIENT 1]
Name="Robert L. Barney"
Birthdate=02,04,54
Sex=M
Smoker=N
Pref=N
PrefPlus=N
FaceAmount=500000
REM
REM   Remember, to pass in each client, the list of client variables 
REM   must be preceded by the appropriate section title, followed by 
REM   the variables for that client.  In this case, the following list 
REM   of variables will set the client 2 section.
REM
[CLIENT 2] 
Name="Patricia K. Barney"
Birthdate=27,04,57
Sex=F
Smoker=N
Pref=N
PrefPlus=N
FaceAmount=250000
REM
REM   Finally you can set variables under the title [GENERAL].  At this 
REM   point the only variable you need be concerned with is the agent 
REM   name.  However, if you are operating Compulife under a personal 
REM   use discount, this variable will be ignored by the program.
REM
[GENERAL]
Agent="Sherlock Holmes, Best Term Detective"
REM
REM   The following variables may also be set under [GENERAL], but we 
REM   recommend not using them at this point as the setting will be 
REM   redundant to normal use of this feature.  We look forward to 
REM   receiving customer feedback as to what other ways they might want 
REM   to use the program or have it integrated to other software.
REM   
REM   Menuchoice=3
REM   PrintAMBestGuide=Y
REM   Agent="Quincy Jones"
REM
REM
REM   The following are the variables used to set the product values for 
REM   Compulife's "Interest Adjusted Cost Analysis" (IACA).  IACA permits
REM   you to compare two products, side by side, year by year, using any
REM   interest and tax assumption you specify.  The products can either be
REM   filed to IACA using the Compulife Quotation System, or the products
REM   can be manually entered.
REM
REM   The following is designed to allow life companies to transfer product
REM   information directly to the IACA program from their own illustration 
REM   software.  For example, a life company may wish to have their U/L 
REM   product transfered into IACA for comparison to a term policy.  
REM   Simply follow the instructions for the creation of a CLIENT.INI file, 
REM   and use the following variables to transfer the product to IACA.
REM
[IACA]
InterestRate=6.25
TaxRate=50.00
REM
REM   Note:  If you do not specify the interest and tax rate, the values
REM   will default to whatever was last entered by the user.
REM
EndingAge=99
Summary=Y
SummaryAge=65
REM
REM   If you are entering the values for one product in the IACA comparison
REM   simply fill in the information for IACA PRODUCT 1 or 2, and leave
REM   the other unspecified.  The system will default to whatever was 
REM   previously entered for the other product.
REM
[IACA PRODUCT 1]
CompanyName="Name of the first company"
ProductName="Name of the first product"
FaceAmount=500000
PresentCSV=0
SummaryCSV=25000
REM
REM   The following will set the premium, for years 1 to 57, to $1,177.50.
REM   Year 1 indicates the year the premium starts.  As there is no
REM   further indication of a year change, the premium of $1,177.50 is 
REM   assumed to continue for ALL years (see the next IACA PRODUCT 2).
REM
Year=1  
Premium=1177.50
[IACA PRODUCT 2]
CompanyName="Name of the second company"
ProductName="Name of the second product"
FaceAmount=500000
REM
REM   Note:  there is no Present CSV for Product 2.
REM
SummaryCSV=25000
Year=1  
Premium=437
REM  
REM   The next year value of 11 tells the system that the premium of
REM   $437 is level from years 1 to 10.   
REM
Year=11
Premium=1450
Year=21
Premium=3700
Year=31
Premium=8325
Year=36
Premium=0
REM
REM   Setting year 36 to 0 tells the system there are no more premiums
REM   after year 35.
