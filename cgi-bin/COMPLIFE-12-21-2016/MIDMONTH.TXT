               * * *  WARNING * * *

This midmonth update is being provided with Version 8 
data files.  

These files are incompatible with past versions of 
Compulife's Internet Engine.

If you use the Windows version of Compulife, or the 
webquote option, or Compulife Basic (the mobile edition),
there is NOTHING that you have to do.  These services 
are being updated automatically.  Ignore this warning.

However, if you have Compulife's Internet Quote Engine,
which mans that our quoting software is actually running 
on your server, and you update the data files from your 
Windows PC version of Compulife to your server, then 
you will need to make sure that you do not place this 
rate update on your server until you have and are ready 
to implement the latest version of the quoting engine.

IF you failed to read this, and updated your server
without updating the engine, you can get the December
monthly update AGAIN, and NOT get this midmonth update.
The will give to the December 2016 version 7 data 
files that can be uploaded to your server, and you 
will not be able to implement this midmonth update
until you get the version 8 internet engine.



The following changes have been made to the December 2016  
edition of the Compulife Quotation System:

4.  American General Life Insurance Company - new rates

December 5th (2nd) - When I duplicated the OLD AG term 
plans for FL, and set up new product codes, I neglected 
to connect the renewal table files to those codes.  

Many thanks to the subscriber who alerted us to the 
problem.  It is now fixed.  A 10% coupon has been given.


3.  American General Life Insurance Company - new rates

December 5th - American General has introduced new rates 
for its Select-a-Term product series.  

The new rates are approved in all states except FL.


2.  United States Life Insurance Company - new rates

December 5th - US Life has introduced new rates for its
Select-a-Term product series.  


1.  Newest Version of Windows Program

December 5th - Compulife is upgrading our data files
from Version 7 to Version 8.  The new data format has
been created to be introduced in conjunction with a new
version of the Compulife internet quoting engine, designed 
to the ongoing piracy of our software. 

Yep, same crew, same ongoing problem.  The good news is
that we are steadily getting closer to our day in court.

If you are using the Windows PC version of Compulife,
Compulife Basic (the mobile edition) or the $96 per year 
web quote option on your website, there is NOTHING you
need to do.  All these services are being updated
AUTOMATICALLY.  




================================================================

The following changes were made and were included with the 
December 2016 monthly update of the Compulife Quotation System:

14.  Lincoln National - quarterly mode removed

December Monthly Update - Lincoln National no longer 
offers quarterly premium payment options for it's life
insurance products.


13.  Pacific Life Insurance Company - preferred health criteria

November 28th (2nd) - We assumed Pacific Life was using 
the same preferred health criteria for their new PL Promise
Term as their Primer Term.  That is not correct.  It is
quite different.

We have now added the preferred health criteria for the
PL Promise Term products.


12.  Pacific Life Insurance Company - conversion correction

November 28th - Pacific Life's new term series call PL 
Promise Term is convertible for the lesser of the level
premium period, or to age 70.  


11.  John Hancock Life - state approval

November 23rd - John Hancock's Vitality term is now 
approved in AK, CT and MD.

John Hancock wanted us to add a connection to the
description of how the product works, to our system, 
but we just don't have that sort of ability.  

We would emphasize that the purpose of the software
is not to give you exhaustive information about the 
market, but rather is designed to give you a means 
to quickly and easily compare similiar products by
price.  After that, if you need further information
about what a product offers, we STRONGLY recommend 
you contact the Home Office or the distribution 
channel that you use.

Here is what John Hancock wanted you to see:

10.  A.M. Best Ratings

November 18th - We rarely discuss other information we 
update in our software, related to products and rates, 
simply because discussing the VOLUME of such information 
would make these bulletins more difficult to read than 
it appears they are already.

This update includes a number of A.M. Best changes I 
was unable to process due to a week in Florida related
to the copyright infringement lawsuit which Compulife
has commenced in U.S. Federal Court.  

I have now returned and A.M. Best and some other 
changes to the software have been updated.


9.  Pacific Life Insurance Company - new product

November 17th - Pacific Life has introduced a new term 
series call PL Promise Term 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30.  


8.  New York Life - new rates

November 8th - On November 2nd New York Life introduced
new rates for their 10, 15 and 20 year level term plans.
Compulife received the rates at about 5pm this evening.

Previous to the last rate/product change, the company
was still quoting their previous product in NY.  We
have not yet learned if that product has been updated,
so the new rates are in our software for all non-NY
states.  We'll let you know when the company responds
to our questions in that regard.


7.  United Farm Family Life - product name change

November 8th - Untited Farm Family has changed the name
of its term plans from Express Iusse Term 20 and 30 to
Simple Term 20 and 30.  It has also changed the name of
its 20 year ROP term plan from Premier 20 to Simple

6.  United Home Life - product name change

November 8th - Untited Home Life has changed the name
of its term plans from Express Iusse Term 20 and 30 to
Simple Term 20 and 30.  It has also changed the name of

Term 20 ROP.  


5.  Nationwide Life Insurance - new No-Lapse UL rates

November 7th - Nationwide has increased premiums for
its no lapse UL products.  At the time of the release,

Whole Life product for Sentinel Security Life.
