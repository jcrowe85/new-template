<p>Permanent life insurance is what most people think they're buying when buying life insurance. But contrary to what people think, most people don't need to buy it or they need to buy very little of it. There are only a few cases where buying large permanent policies is a viable solution.</p>
 
<p>Permanent policies generally also have investment accounts that really should be a secondary reason to buy a policy. We will never recommend that you purchase a permanent policy just so that you can have an investment account.</p>
